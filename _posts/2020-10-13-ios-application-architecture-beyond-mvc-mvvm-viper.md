title:  "[ios] On iOS application architecture beyond MVC, MVVM, and VIPER"
categories: ios architecture
---

After years of building, researching, experimenting, and iterating on iOS application architectures, I've gathered my learnings and conclusions so far into a single document. This is a document I would love to have had when I first started developing iOS applications.

It goes beyond standard architectural patterns like MVC, MVVM, and VIPER, which you are most likely to stumble upon in the iOS community. It includes powerful insights into architecting long-lasting iOS applications regardless of the architectural patterns used.

You can download it <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/ios-application-architecture-by-srdan-stanic.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'PDF', 'Download', 'iOS Architecture PDF');">here</a>.

I'm curious to hear if you found it helpful, disagreeable, or both, so please let me know either way. You can leave a comment below or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/srstanic){:target="_blank"}<!-- markup clean_ -->.
